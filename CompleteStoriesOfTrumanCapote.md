Truman Capote is a genius. 
Most of the stories are great, but the best ones are where you are absolutely sure that the author has witnessed them. 
In these stories the characters are truly alive and so unique that everything must be real. From the swamps of Alabama to the decadent New York parties.
Stories are ordered chronologically and I preffered his later work where Capote is a more refined writer and focuses on his own life experiences.
