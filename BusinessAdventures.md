A fun, newspaper like collection of shorty stories about business. I definitely enjoyed most the mid century vibe of some of the stories. Classic tales of wall street and white man in suites.
* Xerox was a premium technology company of its time, with a technological revolution that would sweep the US over night - faxes.
* The great corner is a fascinating story of the last big corenr in wall street - when a spekulator is trying to squize all the short sellers by buying all the remaining stock of the company. Funnily enough this was also happening with the GameStop stock as I was reading the book.
* Profesional stock activists are people who control the voting rights of some stock and their full time job is going from one shareholder meeting to the other. They usually fight the board and in spectecular fashion in front of live crowds.
