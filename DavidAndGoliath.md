Not a cohesive story. Many independent chapters try to connect to the original David and Goliath battle, but the connection is usually weak.

* The battle of David and Goliath is not what it seems at first. The small David is actually better armed, he has a ranged sling, while Goliath is partly blind.
* In the battle of weak against the strong most of the cases the weak will win if the fighting is done under the conditions that benefit the weak. Example: Vietnam vs USA
* Some flaws can actually be used as advantages if done right: most dyslexics end up being great enterpreanurs.
