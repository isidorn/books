Beautifuly written tale of the Glas family and its two youngest members: Franny and Zooey. Both characters are extremily intelligent, young and full of convictions. They are perfectly neurotic and easy to fall in love with as the story unfolds.
Hidden religious motives dominate this book, probably fuelled by Salindger's own search for spiritual meaning in his life.
Atmosphere of New York City in the 50s is also ever present and draws you in.
