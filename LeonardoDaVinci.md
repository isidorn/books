Great biography of one of the most creative minds in our history. Author does a great job of getting into the mind of Leonardo and appreciating the way he thinks, acts and enjoys life.

* Leonardo did not publish all his work and findings, he could easily consume himself in a new interest. And because of that a lot of his findings had to be rediscoverd in the future centuries.
* Leonardo was a perfectionist: some work he continued improving until his death, and in order to create a horse scuplture we would first disect multiple horses to understand them perfectly.
