This book covers 20th century Germany, from the colonial times to post World War Two. 
There's also love involved, but the story telling does not draw you in and is very bleak. Tells the story of a boring life in a boring way.
Author is reasoning how Germany has always wanted more and that it's megalomany got the best of the country every time. From trying to have colonies in Africa to wanting to conquer the rest of the world in each World War.
I found the Short descriptions of the colonial times interesting, but the rest of the book covers topics that have already been covered so many times.
