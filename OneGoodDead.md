David Baldacci wrote a great thriller that reads easily just like watching a movie. It was a lovely read for the beach and has made me understand that literature like this is a precondition when packing for a long vacation.
The book is set in 50s in a small town of Poca City. The author describes the athomsphere well and sucks you into it's dirty streets and joints.
Some of the characters are a bit too generic and lack authenticity and the ending could have been more creative. Non the less, the book gave me a superb time while reading it and trying to figure out how the plot unfolds.
